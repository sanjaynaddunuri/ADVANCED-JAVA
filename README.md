# 🌐 ADVANCED‑JAVA

An advanced exploration into Java enterprise development, focusing on frameworks, multithreading, web services, and database connectivity. Elevate your Core‑Java skills with modular, scalable, and production-ready patterns.

---

## 📚 What’s Inside

This repository includes hands-on projects and examples covering:

- **Multithreading & Concurrency**  
  Utilize `Thread`, `Runnable`, `ExecutorService`, synchronization, and thread-safe collections.

- **Spring Framework Essentials**  
  - Dependency injection via `@Configuration`, `@Bean`, `@Component`, `@Autowired`  
  - Lifecycle annotations: `@PostConstruct`, `@PreDestroy`  
  - JDBC Template for simplified database operations

- **Web Layer**  
  - Servlets: HTTP request/response handling, sessions, filters, event listeners  
  - JSP: dynamic HTML generation with Expression Language and JSTL

- **Database Integration**  
  JDBC + Spring JDBC Template interacting with relational databases

- **Containerization**  
  Dockerfiles and configuration for containerizing Spring applications

- **(Optional) REST/Microservices**  
  Examples of REST endpoints using Spring MVC

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher  
- Maven or Gradle  
- Docker (if building containers)  
- A relational database (e.g., MySQL, Postgres)

### 📥 Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjaynaddunuri/ADVANCED-JAVA.git
cd ADVANCED-JAVA
````

### 🧩 Build & Run

#### With Maven

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run            # If using Spring Boot
```

#### With Gradle

```bash
gradle build
gradle bootRun                # For Spring Boot applications
```

#### Using Docker

```bash
docker build -t advanced-java .
docker run -p 8080:8080 advanced-java
```

## 🧠 Sample Use Cases

### ✔️ Multithreading Example

```java
ExecutorService exec = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
exec.submit(new TranslationTask("Hello", "es"));
exec.shutdown();
```

### ✔️ JDBC Template Query

```java
List<User> users = jdbcTemplate.query("SELECT * FROM users", userRowMapper);
```

### ✔️ Servlet Example

```java
@WebServlet("/hello")
public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet { /* doGet… */ }
```

---

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

* ✅ Master concurrency, synchronization, and thread pools
* ✅ Implement Spring DI, bean scopes, and lifecycle management
* ✅ Build servlets, handle HTTP, manage sessions and JSP views
* ✅ Connect Java apps to databases using JDBC and Spring
* ✅ Package services within Docker containers for deployment workflows

---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

* Add REST endpoints with Spring MVC
* Enhance with Spring Security (authentication/authorization)
* Include unit and integration tests using JUnit & Mockito
* Migrate to Spring Boot for auto-config & simplified tooling
* Use JPA/Hibernate or Spring Data JPA for ORM-based persistence
